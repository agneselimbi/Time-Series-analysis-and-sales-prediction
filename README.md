# Time-Series-analysis-and-sales-prediction

The goal of this project is to forecast the sales of a chain of stores in Ecuador using the SARIMA (Season AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The data comes from the "Store Forecasting" competition in Kaggle. Irnitially, we manually fit the SARIMA model to a store chosen at random then we use the auto.arima package to automatically get the parameters of the SARIMA model. As a next step of this project, I will like to compare the performance of our SARIMA model with other state of the art machine learning models such as : 
  - Prophet
  - LightGBM
